                        a discussion about the Korean American experience with cultural foods like
                        kimchi. The website utilizes on click, tap/press down interactions to take
                        users on a journey of a Korean American trying to recreate his grandma&#39;s
                        kimchi recipe. The website also incoporates data about food supply, 
                        Korean immigration, Korean restaurantes, and kimchi recipes.</p>
