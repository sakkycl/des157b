                    <p>The website opens a discussion about the connection between culture and 
                        heritage with endangered foods. The website celebrates countries&#39; 
                        biological, cultural, and culinary heritage, encouraging farmers, 
                        ranchers, fishers, chefs, grocers, educators, and consumers to protect 
                        foods from the dangers of climate change. The website provides two 
                        large catalogs of both international and American foods. These 
                        catalogs includes information about a variety of foods and their 
                        biological, cultural, and traditional backgrounds. The catalog also 
                        includes information on how the foods are at risk because of 
                        environmental factors. The website and catalogs serves as a place for 
                        people all over the world to celebrate these foods and raise 
                        awareness.</p>

                    <p>Finney, Clare. “Endangered Foods: Why Our Diet Is Narrower than Ever - and the UK Urgently Needs to Save These Seven Foods.” The Guardian, 23 Jan. 2023, <a href="www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/23/endangered-foods-why-our-diet-is-narrower-than-ever-and-these-seven-foods-urgently-need-saving">www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jan/23/endangered-foods-why-our-diet-is-narrower-than-ever-and-these-seven-foods-urgently-need-saving</a>.</p>

                    <p>The article raises concern over the connection between endangered food 
                        issue and the diversity problem in food. The article claims that the 
                        number of products available has increased but the diversity of crops 
                        has decreases globally, with many products being produced from a 
                        limited number of ingredients such as wheat, maize, palm oil, and soy. 
                        This raises nutritional concerns such as more people increasing their 
                        sugar intake and decreasing their fibre intake. The article also 
                        discuses many foods in the UK that are endangered such as cheshire 
                        cheese, beremeal, Norfolk beefing apple, perry, saddleback pigs, 
                        Scottish birch water, and wild Atlantic salmon.</p>

                    <p>The article opens the discussion of the connection between 
                        food and the climate change that is rarely discussed. The article 
                        mentions a variety of foods that are affected by the climate crisis 
                        such as avocados, coffee, wine, chocolate, potatoes, chickpeas, fish, 
                        and bananas. The article reveals that the decline in the production of 
                        these foods are often due to rising temperatures, fresh-water 
                        scarcity, irregular weather patterns, habitats loss, deforestation, 
                        pollution, and vulnerability to plagues. The article raises concern 
                        over the issue because of how it could impact nutrition and 
                        traditional diets across the world and advocates for reversing the 
                        effects of climate change.</p>
