            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>buttons &#40;on-click interactions&#41;</li>
                <li>overlays</li>
                <li>click or tap interactions</li>
                <li>short animations &#40;2-3 frames&#41;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The buttons, or on-click interactions, require using on click event 
                listeners in JavaScript. Overlays require creaing hidden and showing 
                classes in CSS as well as switching the classes in JavaScript. Click 
                or tap interactions also require using event listeners in JavaScript. 
                The short animations require using CSS animation and keyframes. I am 
                familair with the technology required for most of the features in my 
                project to accomplish them within the time frame of the project. I 
                have not used onkeypress events before. However, I think the process 
                may be similar with other event listeners so I will be able to become 
                familiar with it within the timeframe. I also rarely use CSS animation 
                and keyframes. I think I would spend more time reviewing how to use the 
                properties again. However, I still think I would be able to complete them 
                within the timeframe of the project.</p>
