            <h1>Capstone Project Topic Proposal</h1>
    
            <p>The topic I choose is climate change and my target audience are people of all 
                ages, race, and genders because the climate crisis is something that affects 
                all of us. I do not plan to work with a partner. I think a challenge for this 
                topic would be creating a message that would be impactful for a large audience.</p>
            
            <p>One mental mode I focussed on was emphasizing the consequences on climate 
                change on our daily lives such as endangered foods. I thought of incorporate a 
                utopian/dystopian narrative in which certain foods affected by climate change 
                are gone and alternative foods become more common. I could visualize data 
                about people's favorite foods or important foods in different cultures. I 
                also thought of incorporating on-click interactions and overlays to display the 
                data so the user can explore and engage with the site freely. </p>
            
            <p>Another mental mode I focussed on was normalizing the use of public 
                transportation. I thought I can incorporate a utopian/dytopian narrative if 
                public transportation was our only or main mode of transportation, emphasizing 
                what countries would be fine and what countries would struggle. I could 
                incorporate data about the use of public transport in different countries. I 
                also thought of incorporating a scrolling interaction in the website to highlight 
                the data and allow users to explore the data at their own pace.</p>
