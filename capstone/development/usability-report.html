            <h1>Capstone Project Development: Usability Report Results</h1>
            <h2>Observations</h2>
            <p>In my usability test, two of my tasks was to learn about the ingredients 
                of the recipe and reach the end of the game. I noticed that the user click 
                on three ingredients 
                before hovering the mouse around the page, looking for the next step. 
                I noticed that that 
                during the cooking section, users paused, waiting for the animation 
                to fully stop before moving forward in the game. I also noticed when 
                the user reached the end of the game, the user closed the last 
                overlay, opened it again, before clicking the "play again" button to 
                return to the start screen.</p>
            <h2>Changes</h2>
            <p>Based on these observations, I think the user experience would be a lot 
                smoother if I included more user feedback. One change I want to make is 
                adding an overlay that alerts user that they need to select all the 
                ingredients before moving onto the step. I also want to add some sort of 
                feedback during the cooking animation to indicate that users can move 
                forward in the game, such as changing the header. I also want to prevent 
                the last overlay from closing to prevent confusion.</p>
